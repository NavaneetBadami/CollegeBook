0.All Common Static Methods which are connected to DATABASE available in CollegeBookCommons SerVlet So fetch them whenever needed.  
1.we Suppose to store Same Name in all Tables and displays in all .jsP file, so we created one hashMap as Static(in loginDao) and added name in that MAP.
2.Additional we need to Store same mobileNo in MessageDb so we Add mobileNo in same above hashMap and used in mobileController.
3.In LoginDao class used Some tricky logic, So analysis it one by one.
4.In MemoriesSnap servleT we suppose to store all snap details like snapName, UploadUserName etc..So its imp that snapID and SnapName must be unique, and both should've a relation
  like so we are storing SnapId value +1 at last letter of SnapName to fetch it in later processing.
  - Here we are adding +1 to 'last' SnapID, bcOz when user upload new snap then snapName last letter must be same as SnapID, so it's little bit Tricky analysis it properly.
